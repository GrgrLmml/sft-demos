The probability of the spinner landing on $A$ is $\\\\frac{1}{3}$ and the probability of the spinner landing on $B$ is $\\\\frac{5}{12}$.  What is the probability of the spinner landing on $C$? Express your answer as a common fraction. [/INST] To find the probability of the spinner landing on $C$, I need to subtract the probabilities of the spinner landing on $A$ and $B$ from $1$, since the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is $1$. I can write this as an equation: $P(C) = 1 - P(A) - P(B)$. I know that $P(A) = \\\\frac{1}{3}$ and $P(B) = \\\\frac{5}{12}$, so I can plug those values into the equation and simplify. I get: $P(C) = 1 - \\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{5}{12} = \\\\frac{12}{12} - \\\\frac{4}{12} - \\\\frac{5}{12} = \\\\frac{3}{12}$. I can reduce this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by $3$, and I get: $P(C) = \\\\frac{1}{4}$. <|endoftext|> '}\n",

You know, we were just playing tag, or as I liked to call it, \"The Office Olympics.\" We would be laughing, joking, and having the best Dundie Award-winning time ever.\\n\\nAnd then there was this one moment - you know those moments where everything just feels so perfect, like when Pam finally kisses Jim at Casino Night? Yeah, it was like that. The sun was setting, casting this golden glow on everyone\\'s faces, and for a second, we all just stopped running and looked at each other. It was like our own version of the World\\'s Best Boss mug, filled to the brim with pure happiness.\\n\\nIn that moment, we weren\\'t just kids anymore; we were a family, bound together by love and laughter, like the cast of The Office during their final episode. And even though we\\'ve grown up and gone our separate ways, I\\'ll always cherish that memory, because it reminds me that no matter what life throws at us, we can always find our way back to each other, just like how Michael found his way back to Dunder Mifflin after starting the Michael Scott Paper Company.\\n\\nThat\\'s what she said!<|endoftext|> '}\n",

In a written agreement between FGF and Gourmet Mart (\"GM\"), a retail seller of fine quality foods, FGF agreed to \"sell all output of Fat Goose Foods liver pate to Gourmet Mart,\" and GM agreed to \"sell Fat Goose Foods pates exclusively.\" The agreement went on to state that GM would pay $ 150$ for each 10 -loaf container of pates ordered from FGF. The agreement between GM and FGF also contained the statement, \"either party may cancel this contract after two months upon giving reasonable notice to the other party.\" Assume that, after FGF faithfully filled GM's orders for six months, FGF determined that it was becoming too costly to operate the special oven used to roast the pate loaves. The oven had been manufactured in Belgium in 1937, but the plant that manufactured the oven was destroyed by bombing during World War II, and no more of the ovens were produced after 1940. It would be difficult and expensive to find a suitable substitute, and when the oven malfunctioned, replacement parts were extremely difficult to find and very costly as well. FGF, therefore, decided to get out of the pate business entirely and to use its supply of goose livers to make a German-style liver sausage. FGF notified GM of its decision and the reasons for it, and shortly thereafter stopped shipping pate to GM. GM sued FGF, demanding that FGF continue to ship pate to GM or pay monetary damages to GM.

Many of these byproducts were highly toxic; thus, Gasmask took great care in selecting a dump site. A highly reputable engineering company was hired and an exhaustive survey was performed. Finally the Temblor Canyon site was selected and the chemicals were stored there underground, using state-of-the-art techniques. Although the survey and attendant geological soundings were performed with consummate skill, the surveyors failed to discover a crack in the rock of the storage area that was too small for their instruments to detect. Over a period of years the chemicals began to seep through the crack and into the water table below the surface. Scientists in nearby Canyon City discovered that the city's water supply, all of which came from local wells that tapped into the water table, contained unacceptably high levels of chemical contaminants. Canyon City was required to spend $ 5$ million on a complex filtration system to remove the dangerous chemicals from its water.

After notice to Keith and a hearing, a judge granted the order and the state seized the property. Six months later, after the time for any appeals had expired, the property was sold at a public auction to a third party. It was only when the third party brought an action to quiet title that Northwest Bank, the holder of a properly recorded mortgage on Keith's property, learned of the forfeiture.

The legislature recognized that much of the \"welfare and poverty problem\" was centered on poor single-parent households headed by a woman. Therefore, it decreed in the legislation that all counseling would be free for single mothers with an income of less than $ 20,000$ per year. Others would have to pay fees for the counseling on a sliding scale depending upon income. The counseling services available at the State Family Counseling Centers included classes on parenting, anti-substance abuse programs, and financial counseling. The counseling centers were popular and other states considered copying the Margate model. Peter's wife had died recently of a drug overdose, and he was left to care for their two children (ages two and four) on an income of approximately $ 7,000$ per year. Peter had no idea how he could manage to care for the two children and himself on his small paychecks. He heard about the State Family Counseling Centers and went to the closest one for financial counseling. Peter was told that he would have to pay a $ 50$ fee for the counseling. Peter had $ 10$ in his pocket, which he needed for bus fare home and to feed his children until his check, due in five days, arrived. Peter became very angry when he learned that single mothers in his situation were entitled to free counseling while single fathers were not.

Therefore, he sold Blueacre to Brett. According to the terms of the agreement signed by the parties, Brett took Blueacre \"subject to the mortgage\" and agreed to \"assume payment of' the mortgage.

Patchquilt was a municipality located in a very warm climate. Many Patchquilt residents were on welfare, and the town contained no major industry or shopping district to bolster its tax base. Patchquilt employed only three refuse collectors and asserted reasonably that it could not afford to hire more. However, during the warmest times of the year, extra refuse collections were routine because of the city council's fear that rotting garbage in the hot climate could contribute to the spread of disease. During the hottest months, the three refuse collectors in Patchquilt regularly worked well beyond the 40 hours per week standard. Because of normal vacation time and the normally heavy garbage collection schedule, it would not be possible to give the refuse collectors additional time off during the cooler months, which were not always very cool, without hiring additional refuse collectors.

The legislature recognized that much of the \"welfare and poverty problem\" was centered on poor single-parent households headed by a woman. Therefore, it decreed in the legislation that all counseling would be free for single mothers with an income of less than $ 20,000$ per year. Others would have to pay fees for the counseling on a sliding scale depending upon income. The counseling services available at the State Family Counseling Centers included classes on parenting, anti-substance abuse programs, and financial counseling. The counseling centers were popular and other states considered copying the Margate model. Peter's wife had died recently of a drug overdose, and he was left to care for their two children (ages two and four) on an income of approximately $ 7,000$ per year. Peter had no idea how he could manage to care for the two children and himself on his small paychecks. He heard about the State Family Counseling Centers and went to the closest one for financial counseling. Peter was told that he would have to pay a $ 50$ fee for the counseling. Peter had $ 10$ in his pocket, which he needed for bus fare home and to feed his children until his check, due in five days, arrived. Peter became very angry when he learned that single mothers in his situation were entitled to free counseling while single fathers were not.

It would be difficult and expensive to find a suitable substitute, and when the oven malfunctioned, replacement parts were extremely difficult to find and very costly as well.

Nick dressed quickly and took off out the back door. Howard screamed a number of epithets at Chastity and then told her, \"Nick's going to pay for this! Get me a drink!

Hardsell Motors, Inc., a franchised Doppelpferd dealer in the United States, contracted with Shift to sell him a new Doppelpferd for $ 9,000$ cash, the sale to be consummated after delivery to Hardsell of the car, which Hardsell ordered from the manufacturer specifically for Shift. The signed retail contractual document was a form drafted by Hardsell's lawyer, and Shift did not question or object to any of its terms, including the price inserted by Hardsell. When the car arrived from Germany, Shift repudiated the contract.

To save money, he decided to act as the general contractor and hire all of the subcontractors himself.

The first night that Jason stayed there, however, a fire swept through the house. Jason managed to escape with a broken ankle and some minor burns, but the house was a total loss. An investigation by the fire marshal established that the fire started from a short in some wiring behind a wall. A small section of wiring that ran to an outlet through a narrow gap between a furnace chimney and a hot water pipe had had part of its outer sheath cut off. Both the chimney and the pipe had been installed, and the walls put up, after the rough wiring had been completed. Jason filed suit against Shortstop Electrical Service, the contractor that did the rough wiring. The parties stipulated that Shortstop had installed the wiring in compliance with the detailed blueprints that Jason had drawn up, and that the wiring had been inspected and approved by the building inspector shortly after it had been installed. At trial, Jason introduced the report of the fire marshal establishing the above facts and evidence of his medical expenses and other damages.

[/INST] We are to find the smallest positive solution to the system of congruences$$ \\begin{aligned} &x \\equiv 1(\\bmod 60), \\\\ &x \\equiv 0(\\bmod 7). \\end{aligned} $$The general solution is $7 b_{1}+420 t$, where $b_{1}$ is the inverse of 7 modulo 60 and $t$ is an integer. Since $b_{1}$ is a solution to the Diophantine equation $7 b_{1}+60 y=1$, we find it using Euclid's algorithm. Here is how to do it: $60=8 \\cdot 7+4,7=1 \\cdot 4+3,4=1 \\cdot 3+1$. Then$$ \\begin{aligned} 1 &=4-1 \\cdot 3=4-1 \\cdot(7-1 \\cdot 4)=2 \\cdot 4-7=2 \\cdot(60-8 \\cdot 7)-7 \\\\ &=2 \\cdot 60-17 \\cdot 7 \\end{aligned} $$Hence $b_{1}=-17$, and the smallest positive number of the form $7 b_{1}+420 t$ is $-7 \\cdot 17+$ $420 \\cdot 1=301$.<|endoftext|>  This instance will be ignored in loss calculation.
